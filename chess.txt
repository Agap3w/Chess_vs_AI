‚ùó MISSING:

1. Gameplay Features:
- Check/Checkmate Detection: Visual or text-based notification when the game reaches check, checkmate, or stalemate.
- Pawn Promotion: Handling promotions when a pawn reaches the opposite end. A simple prompt or automatic queen promotion is needed.
- Game End States: Display appropriate messages for checkmate, stalemate, or draw conditions.

2. User Experience Enhancements:
- Move Highlighting: Show legal moves for the selected piece.
- Piece Capturing Animation (Optional): Provide visual feedback for captures.
- Undo Functionality: Allow players to undo the last move.

3. Advanced Features for AI Integration:
- Basic AI Player: Implement a simple random-move AI using chess.Board.legal_moves.
- Minimax Algorithm: Introduce a decision tree for better AI performance.
- Evaluation Heuristics: Use a simple heuristic like material value for better decision-making.

4. Polishing and Maintenance:
- Save/Load Game: Serialize the game state for saving and loading.
- Error Handling: Ensure graceful handling of illegal moves or exceptions during play.
- Sound Effects (Optional): Add sounds for piece moves and captures.


üöÄ Suggested ROADMAP:

1. Game Rules: Add checkmate and promotion handling.
2. UI Enhancements: Highlight moves and introduce undo functionality.
3. AI Development: Build and refine AI step by step.
4. Game Persistence: Implement save/load feature.
5. Polish: Add animations and sounds for better user experience.



üïê Deep Dive su Point 1:
Check/Checkmate Detection: 1-2 hours

The logic is mostly handled by python-chess. You just need to display game-ending messages and handle the is_check() and is_checkmate() methods properly.
Pawn Promotion: 1-2 hours

Simple automatic promotion to a queen can be quick (~30 minutes).
If you want a user-selectable piece promotion (like prompting for queen, rook, knight, or bishop), expect ~2 hours for UI work and user input handling.
Castling: ~1 hour

python-chess already manages legal castling moves. You mainly need to ensure the GUI correctly handles and animates king and rook movement.
En Passant: 1-1.5 hours

The library handles legality; you only need to ensure captured pawns are removed correctly from the board and display it visually in the GUI.

üîç Suggested Order:
1. Check/Checkmate Detection: Handle the endgame messages first.
2. Pawn Promotion: Start with automatic promotion, then build an interactive version later.
3. Castling: Ensure that the rook and king move correctly.
4. En Passant: Test and visually confirm that the captured pawn disappears correctly.
